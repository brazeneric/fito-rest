# fito-rest

It's no secret that [Fitocracy.com](fitocracy.com) has seen better days.  The new ownership seems far more concerned 
with selling online coaching than with maintaining the original core product.  When the prop system broke in January 
2019, and remained broken for several days, I realized it was time to start doomsday prepping for the eventual shutdown
of the site. While I've really enjoyed both the community and the gamification, the thing I can't lose is my fitness 
log.

This project was thrown together to pull a Fitocracy user's full exercise log, both for posterity and for playing 
around with the data.  Future functionality might include user quests, achievements, and social data.  Fork awayâ€”I'd
love to see what you do with it!
